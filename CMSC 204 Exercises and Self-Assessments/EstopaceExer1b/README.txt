    Brief Summary of what I did in the App

    1. created a patient class that acts as a template for patient data
    2. created a custom node class that contains the patient data and will identify the next node
    3. created methods for the node only (i.e. print method to print the node)
    4. created a custom linked list class that will determine the header and tail
    5. created custom methods for the linked list (e.g. insert to end method, print, etc.)

    In the Console App > View folder, I...
    6. created the custom methods to resemble pages for each option in the persisting display menu.
